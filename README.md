## About

“Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables
verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A DID refers to any subject (e.g., a
person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) as determined by
the controller of the DID. In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, DIDs
have been designed so that they may be decoupled from centralized registries,
identity providers, and certificate authorities.”

The implementation fully covers [W3C's standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core)
without use of third party libraries. Developers can follow their own preference
for technologies such as JWK or multibase if needed.
